### 🛠️ Core Hangman

#### Description

Completed program should:

- Randomly choose a word from an internal list.
- Accept single-letter guesses and validate input (ignore repeats/non-letters).
- Display the current word state with underscores for unknown letters (example: `_ a _ _ m a n`).
- Track and show remaining incorrect attempts.
- Track and display letters already guessed.
- End with a clear win or loss message and reveal the full word on loss.

### 🛠️ Enhancements (optional)

#### Description
Add at least one enhancement that improves gameplay or user experience.

#### Requirements

- Example enhancements: load words from `words.txt`, add difficulty levels, or show simple session statistics.
